### Using [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)

You install `nodemon` as a (dev) package and then do something like `nodemon ./server.js arg0 arg1`.

You can configure it all through CLI, `nodemonConfig` region in the `package.json`, or by providing a config file (usually `nodemon.json`).
